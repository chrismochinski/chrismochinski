## Greetings! 👋

### My name is Chris. Everyone calls me "Mo" - even my parents, sometimes. 

- I'm currently buttoning up a two-week solo sprint featuring a Cryptocurrency Market Data & Portfolio Tracker 📈  which my awesome stepkid named [**"Magic Beans"**](https://secure-bayou-02606.herokuapp.com/).

- This week, I dove headfirst into C# / .NET 👨‍💻 and am wrapping up some pair programming on a Pet Hotel Management Application.

- FUN FACT: 🍞 I eat a single slice of peanut butter toast every night around 10:30 PM. Yes, I understand this is strange.

### I'd love to hear from you! 💬
