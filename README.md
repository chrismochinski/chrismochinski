## Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Chris. Everyone calls me "Mo" - even my parents, sometimes.

#### I'm currently buttoning up a two-week solo sprint featuring a Cryptocurrency Market Data & Portfolio Tracker which my awesome stepkid named _"Magic Beans"_.

#### This week, I dove headfirst into C# / .NET and am wrapping up some pair programming on a Pet Hotel Management Application.

#### FUN FACT: I eat a single slice of peanut butter toast every night around 10:30 PM. Yes, I understand this is strange.

### I'd love to hear from you!
